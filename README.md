# Template-Portal
Template portal is a project focused on managing the tasks/schedules assigned to the faculties of the institute. The task / schedules are managed by the Head of the Department(HOD). The system will allow HODs to assign tasks to faculty members, manage
these tasks, and store all relevant data. The portal will ensure no duplicate tasks are
assigned and will maintain a record of all tasks and their statuses.
